## 📖 About The Project

The **Support Ticket Management System** is a RESTful API backend built for managing customer support tickets. It allows support teams to:

- Create, view, update, and delete tickets
- Track ticket status (Open, In Progress, Closed)
- Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Manage customer information
- Search tickets by keyword
- View dashboard statistics

This is the backend component of a full-stack web application, built as part of the CODOC Intern Development Programme assignment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bilalmughal-07/support-ticket-management-system.git
cd support-ticket-management-system
```

2. **Switch to the backend branch**

```bash
git checkout issue-1-backend-database-setup
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Approve SQLite3 build scripts** (if prompted)

```bash
npm approve-scripts sqlite3
```

5. **Verify the `package.json` scripts**

Ensure your `package.json` has these scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server/server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server/server.js"
}
```

### Running the Server

Start the development server with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
✅ Connected to SQLite database.
✅ Schema created.
✅ Seed data inserted.
✅ Server is listening on http://localhost:5000
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:5000`
